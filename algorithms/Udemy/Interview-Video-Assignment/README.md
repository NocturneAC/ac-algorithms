**Understanding the importance of the coding interview**
1. Enroll in this [Udemy course](https://anniecannons.udemy.com/course/coding-interview-bootcamp-algorithms-and-data-structure/learn/quiz/4990668#overview)
2. Watch the following two videos and write down 2-4 observations or questions for each one.
3. a. [The All Important Coding Interview](https://anniecannons.udemy.com/course/coding-interview-bootcamp-algorithms-and-data-structure/learn/lecture/8533042#overview)
   Not much to say for this video, other than it made me feel like I have to take the whole course. I'm a little worried about expectations for tech companies when it comes to things like memory issues; I always take notes and etc because of my short-term memory loss and I am curious how accomodating these companies will be.
      I guess maybe that will be a major determining factor for whether or not we're a good fit for each other culturally.
   b. [Getting Better at Coding Questions](https://anniecannons.udemy.com/course/coding-interview-bootcamp-algorithms-and-data-structure/learn/lecture/8533046#overview)
      Observation number one: Whiteboarding sounds terrifying and I want to be able to confidently do it
      Observation number two: The FizzBuzz whiteboard example does sound hard, and I'd like to succeed at writing it
      Observatoin number three: i want to work on more algorithms regularly so i can become even more confident and familiar with them
